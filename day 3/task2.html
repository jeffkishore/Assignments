    <h2 style="margin-left: 100px;">Idli Kadai Serves Up a Heartwarming Rural Drama</h2>
    <p>Released a day before its competitor, Dhanush's directorial and starring vehicle, Idli Kadai, has also found its footing, despite facing a massive box office clash.

    <p>The film has started its theatrical run on a solid note, with a reported collection of over ₹10 crore on its opening day, primarily from its home state of Tamil Nadu. Despite the release of Kantara: Chapter 1 on its second day, Idli Kadai continues to draw in family audiences, showing a steady collection trend. The film's success is a testament to Dhanush's star power and the enduring appeal of a simple, emotional story.</p>
