JavaScript was created in **1995** by **Brendan Eich** while working at **Netscape**, initially under the name *Mocha*, then *LiveScript*, and finally renamed to *JavaScript*. It was designed to make web pages interactive and dynamic. In **1997**, JavaScript was standardized by **ECMA International** under the name **ECMAScript**, with the first official version known as **ES1**.

Over the next few years, JavaScript evolved gradually. **ES2 (1998)** made small editorial updates, while **ES3 (1999)** brought important new features like **regular expressions**, **try/catch** error handling, and **better string manipulation**. In the mid-2000s, JavaScript gained massive popularity with the rise of **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**, which allowed web pages to update content without reloading, paving the way for dynamic web apps like Gmail and Google Maps.

In **2009**, **Node.js** was introduced by **Ryan Dahl**, enabling JavaScript to run on servers, not just browsers — this was a major milestone that expanded its reach to backend development. Then, in **2015**, **ECMAScript 6 (ES6)** — also known as **ECMAScript 2015** — revolutionized the language with features like **classes, arrow functions, promises, modules, and block-scoped variables (`let` and `const`)**, making JavaScript cleaner and more powerful.

Since 2016, JavaScript has been receiving **annual updates**, each introducing new features such as **async/await**, **optional chaining**, **modules**, and **improved performance**. In **2019**, the **Node.js Foundation** merged with the **JS Foundation** to form the **OpenJS Foundation**, which now supports the entire JavaScript ecosystem.

Today, JavaScript extends far beyond web browsers. Using frameworks like **Electron**, it powers **desktop apps** (e.g., VS Code), and with **React Native**, it drives **mobile app development**. From its humble beginnings as a simple browser scripting tool, JavaScript has evolved into one of the **most versatile and widely used programming languages in the world**, powering everything from small websites to large-scale web, mobile, and desktop applications.
